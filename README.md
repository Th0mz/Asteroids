## Asteroids
Asteroids, a classic within the arcade gaming realm, was introduced in 1979. In this game, participants take control of a triangular spaceship as they navigate through an asteroid field. The primary objective is to survive as long as possible while accumulating the maximum amount of points through precise targeting and destruction of asteroids, all while avoiding collisions and repelling UFO adversaries. This top-down shooter engages players with its distinctive wraparound screen edges, delivering a memorable gaming encounter.

Building upon the original concept, we're considering exciting additions, such as introducing new types of UFO enemies. For instance, kamikaze UFOs that relentlessly fly toward the player, although they can't shoot. Furthermore, we're exploring the possibility of implementing mouse input for spaceship control and shooting, as well as local co-op multiplayer.
